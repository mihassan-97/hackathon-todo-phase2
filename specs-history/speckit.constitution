# Phase-2 Constitution

## Development Rules
- This project must follow Spec-Driven Development strictly.
- No feature implementation without a written specification.
- All changes must be driven by specs and tasks.
- Each task must be completed one at a time.

## Architecture
- Frontend: Next.js (React)
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Communication: REST APIs (JSON)
- State management handled by backend

## Constraints
- No database in Phase-2 (in-memory storage only)
- Clean, readable, and minimal code
- Focus on correctness over optimization

## Quality Standards
- Clear separation of frontend and backend
- Predictable API behavior
- User-friendly UI
- Error handling must be explicit
